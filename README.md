Hello Everyone!

Samuel Wheeler, I think I've had my GitHub account for some time now but have done very little with it. I first checked GitHub out when I was trying to apply for a job with a company by the name of MX in Utah. It ended up not working out, but that's ok. Now I'm back delving back into programming after some time away and falling in love again with watching code come together to create something new and interesting.

I've been coding for some time now. It started back when I was 14 when I first taught myself basic HTML. At the time it seemed like something fancy and amazing. Now that I'm older (29 as of the creating of this commit) I've expanded my understanding to realize that what I had learned at 14 wasn't really even the tip of the iceberg. I've since expanded my understanding to include more HTML, C++, and C#. Thanks to freeCodeCamp, I've also been expanding into some CSS and JavaScript.
